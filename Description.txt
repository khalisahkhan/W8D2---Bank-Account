The attributes `__accountNumber`,` __accountHolder`, and `__balance` are private (indicated by the double underscores). This encapsulation 
ensures that these attributes cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

The `__init__` method initializes the account number, account holder, and balance when a new BankAccount object is created.

The `deposit` method adds the specified amount to the balance if the amount is positive. It prints an error message if the amount 
is not positive.

The `withdraw` method subtracts the specified amount from the balance if the amount is positive and there are sufficient funds. It 
prints error messages if the amount is not positive or if there are insufficient funds.

The `getBalance` method returns the current balance. It's used internally within the class and could be exposed if needed.

The `displayAccountInfo` method prints out the account number, holder's name, and current balance.

The `main` function creates instances of the BankAccount class, performs transactions, and displays account details to demonstrate the 
usage of the class.
